# Malvales
> ðŸ•Š Public interfaces and functions for Hilbish native modules.

This repository holds public Go interfaces and functions to facilitate
native user modules for Hilbish. These will be used to ensure validity
in modules and to provide utility functions for creating and exposing them.

Why is it named Malvales? Because they are the order of Hibiscus, what the
name Hilbish is roughly taken from.
